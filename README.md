# Black and white canvas examples
Js creative coding examples using &lt;canvas>.

This project contains reworked examples of creative coding from the course "Creative Coding: Making Visuals with JavaScript" (Domestika).
The main difference is that while the course focuses on file export and printing, I decided to re-create the designs for the web.

My repository [canvas-hero](https://github.com/p-vale/canvas-hero) is more design-oriented and experimental.
