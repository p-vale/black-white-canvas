# Black and white canvas examples
Js creative coding examples using &lt;canvas>.

This project contains examples of creative coding from the course "Creative Coding: Making Visuals with JavaScript" (Domestika).

The main difference is that while the course focuses on file export and printing, I decided to implement the designs for the web.
